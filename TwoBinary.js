/**
 * Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.
Example 1:
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"

Pseudocode:
Initialize variables:

Use carry to track any overflow from the sum of two bits (either 0 or 1).
Create an empty array result to store the bits of the resulting binary number.
Traverse both binary strings from the end to the start (right to left):

Use two pointers: i for the first string and j for the second string.
For each position, add the corresponding bits from both strings and the carry from the previous addition.
Add the bits:

Convert the characters '0' and '1' to integers and sum them along with the carry.
Compute the resulting bit to store in the result as sum % 2.
Update the carry as Math.floor(sum / 2) (which will be either 0 or 1).
Handle remaining carry:

If thereâ€™s a carry left after processing all bits, append '1' to the result.
Return the result:

Since the result is constructed from right to left, reverse it and join the bits into a string.
 * @param {string} a
 * @param {string} b
 * @return {string}

// Example usage
console.log(addBinary("1010", "1011"));  // Output: "10101"
